            As the first Latina and third woman appointed to the Supreme Court,
            Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor has made an impact in and out of
            the courtroom. With her dedication to the judicial process and
            fighting spirit, Justice Sotomayor is an inspiration, especially for
            Americans who feel marginalized or underrepresented.

            The popularity of Selena's music and persona has endured through the
            years. Selena was posthumously honored with a star on the Hollywood
            Walk of Fame on November 3, 2017, proclaimed "Selena Day" in Los
            Angeles by Mayor Eric Garcetti. That year, reality star Kim
            Kardashian West also dressed up as the Tejano singer as part of her
            homage to music legends for Halloween. In February 2019, Texas State
            Representative Ana-Maria Ramos introduced a bill that would
            designate April 16, Selena's birthday, as a holiday. That year, San
            Diego State University also announced plans to offer a new course,
            "Selena and Latinx Media Representation," to begin in 2020. In March
            2020, Selena became the first Latina artist and the ninth person
            overall to be inducted into the Star Trail of Fame outside the
            Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo.

            America Georgine Ferrera is an American actress who became a star
            with her title role in the popular television series ‘Ugly Betty’.
            Interested in acting since she was in school, she performed in
            several school stage productions and came into prominence with her
            debut film, ‘Real Women Have Curves’. While her performance in ‘The
            Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants’ gained her more recognition, she
            won critical acclaim for portraying the protagonist in the
            television series ‘Ugly Betty’, which garnered her a number of Best
            Actress Awards, including the Golden Globe Award, the Screen Actors
            Guild Award, and the Primetime Emmy Award. The unique role in ‘Ugly
            Betty’ and her subsequent roles thereafter made her a "role model"
            for the young Hispanic women in the entertainment industry, and
            Congresswoman Hilda L. Solis congratulated her for the same. Ferrera
            was dubbed as one of the 100 most influential people in the world in
            2007 by Time magazine. An ardent supporter of ‘Save the Children’
            campaign, she is also an ambassador for it. As part of her social
            work, she traveled to India to meet the children of sex workers and
            raise awareness against sex trafficking.

            When Huerta was a child she moved to Stockton, California, with her
            mother and siblings after her parents’ divorce. She remained in
            touch with her father, Juan Fernández, and took pride in his
            personal and professional development from coal miner to migrant
            labourer to union activist to an elected representative in the New
            Mexico state legislature to college graduate. Unlike many women of
            her era, she went on to college, after graduating from Stockton High
            School. Although a brief marriage, motherhood, and divorce
            interrupted her studies, she eventually received an A.A. degree from
            Stockton College. A series of unsatisfying jobs led her to seek a
            teaching credential, but her teaching career lasted only a few
            months. Huerta decided that she could do more for the hungry and
            barefoot farmworkers’ children in her class by helping their parents
            win more equitable working conditions. As an employee of a
            Mexican-American self-help association called the Community Service
            Organization (CSO), Huerta lobbied California state legislators to
            enact such progressive legislation as old-age pensions for
            noncitizens.

            Frida Kahlo, in full Frida Kahlo de Rivera, original name Magdalena
            Carmen Frieda Kahlo y Calderón, (born July 6, 1907, Coyoacán,
            Mexico—died July 13, 1954, Coyoacán), Mexican painter best known for
            her uncompromising and brilliantly coloured self-portraits that deal
            with such themes as identity, the human body, and death. Although
            she denied the connection, she is often identified as a Surrealist.
            In addition to her work, Kahlo was known for her tumultuous
            relationship with muralist Diego Rivera (married 1929, divorced
            1939, remarried 1940).

            Her reign was supreme, and she captured the imagination of people

            successful and beautiful actresses in Latin American. She shunned
            Hollywood’s seductions and remained true to her roots, but her
            script was a drama including tragic loss, kidnappings, bitter
            rivalries—and murder.
